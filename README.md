# recipe_bok

a WIP flutter project with the following featueres:
* phone authentication - firebase auth
* launcher icons
* dynamically changing themes - material you (required android 12 or highter)
* homepage to see profile - firebase firestore
* route and block WIP



This app should work without any issues in android or in web(chrome/firefox) although it may not work very well with ios as it is not tested on iPhone beacuse I unfortunately do not have access to Xcode and iphone emulator which requires macOS, both of which are important for firebase integration and ios development.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:
